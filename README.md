# Toy_Prolog_Interpreter

Prolog interpreter for simple queries

Just type "make" to build the program.
Once build it will directly prompt for input.
The first line should have the name of the file to give as input. Ex - [a.pl].
Then after queries can be asked.
Only limited queries are supported till now.
